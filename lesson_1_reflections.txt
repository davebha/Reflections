How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file 
help you see bug that was introduced?

It allowed me to compare lines that are changed between 
two versions of the file.

How can having access to entire history of file help me become
better programmer in the long run?

It would allow me to go back to versions with better code base.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

It allows me flexibility to create copies of changes that are more meaningful to me
rather than automatic commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
In many programming projects,the files are interrelated to each other whereas Google Docs is made for single file editing.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
The option --stat  using git log can be used to see overview of all commits created.
It lists the purpose of commit along with unique id.These ids can then be used as a
parameter by command git diff to check the changes that were made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
The ability to get back to previous snapshot of code changes gives me tremendous control over the
code implementation.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
