What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create files to control changes that are happening to multiple files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediate area where user has control of keeping files that they want to keep as part of the commit
before final commit.
The repository contains metadata that are not relevant to user.
The working directory is a storage space that contains repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By laying focus on the feature and not the files,one commit should contain atleast one feature per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
They would help in adding experimental feature to the same project or keep track of different platforms of code.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It uses familiar symbols to help me visualize the branch structure.
