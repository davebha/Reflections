What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create files to control changes that are happening to multiple files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediate area where user has control of keeping files that they want to keep as part of the commit
before final commit.
The repository contains metadata that are not relevant to user.
The working directory is a storage space that contains repository.
