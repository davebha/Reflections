When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working on a large project,it helps to share your code with other people on the project.
In this case,it would be ideal to push your commits to remote repository to finalize changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To make sure that I am content with the changes I made to add to the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is used when cloning a repository on Github.Cloning can be used when cloning a remote or 
local repository.Branching on the other hand can only be done locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It is good to test the changes made by anyone.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I can use alternate version control system like SVN to collaborate on projects.
While SVN allows me to collaborate using remote server,with Git,I can work offline as well.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
If the features themselves can make huge impact on the project itself than I would want it to be in a seperate branch.
This would allow the minor functions to be added in the main workflow while major features can be incorporated on the side
at the same time.
