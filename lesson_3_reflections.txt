When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working on a large project,it helps to share your code with other people on the project.
In this case,it would be ideal to push your commits to remote repository to finalize changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To make sure that I am content with the changes I made to add to the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is used when cloning a repository on Github.Cloning can be used when cloning a remote or 
local repository.Branching on the other hand can only be done locally.
